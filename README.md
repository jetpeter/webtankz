##Usage

You can find the bookmark link at http://dodgecube.com/webtankz/

Clicking the 'Launch' link on the page will load the required java script to add the tank and connect to the server.  The link will work on any page that allows foreign javascript to run.  Only one tank is supported per browser window.  Everyone who is using the bookmarklet is placed in the same instance regardless of what page they started it from.

Control the tank with WASD or the arrow keys. Holding shift will unlock the turret and allow it to rotate without turning the tank.
